# team-balancer
Initial version of a 5v5 team balancer/randomizer for League of Legends I wrote in Java.
Doesn't use any APIs, only references a text file that I put the information into.
Very messy, I was planning on updating this to be functional with a Discord bot,
but I decided to re-write the whole program in Python and use the Python libraries for Riot Games and Discord, so I just stopped looking at this. That's why you can see some notes for future me about updating the program to work with Discord that I left unfinished/untouched.
This version requires the additional input of a player's rank score, which I removed because I can just ask Riot for a player's rank after I know their name, which I do in the Python version.
This is objectively worse in every way compared to the discord-balancer-bot I think, I'm just uploading this to show the precursor program.
